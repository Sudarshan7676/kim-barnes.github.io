	<b>Email: contact@kimberlybarnes.me</b> 
	I’m an Application Support Administrator with an interest in software and CRM administration to create and manage effective workforce workflows.<br/>
	For the past 3 years I have grown into productive IT support roles and supporting both internal and customer service environments.<br/>
	When I’m not on the job, I run a <a href="lipstickandtech.com">style/career/tech blog</a>, indulge in games and movies and eat out at new restaurants with friends.<br/>
